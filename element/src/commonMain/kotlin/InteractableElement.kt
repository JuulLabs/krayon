/**
 * Subclasses of this are able to receive click and hover events inside of an `ElementView`. These
 * subclasses must implement [getInteractionPath] and the individual instances must have a non-null
 * [onClick] or [onHoverChanged] handler set. These events are dispatched to the "top"-most element
 * in the tree that would be able to fire, which occludes other elements below it.
 *
 * _Only_ elements with a set handler occlude other elements (so it may sometimes be useful to set a
 * handler that no-ops to mask off another element's touch). Additionally, click and hover occlusion
 * are handled separately, so an element with a click handler but not a hover handler will not block
 * hover events below it.
 *
 * Note that the term "hover" is often different between platforms. The built-in `ElementView`s try
 * to bridge this gap, and include both _true_ hover (a mouse pointer over the element, un-pressed)
 * as well as the _press_ or _drag_ state (a mouse pointer on the element, pressed; or, a touch) as
 * hover states. This enables use of hover as a pre-selection indicator on mobile devices.
